These are structured in a relatively prescriptive way
Each project is created as a “team” and “area path” in Azure DevOps language.
Overarching areas of work within projects are created as Epics. Many/most projects have a single Epic.
Goals within an area are created as Features. Features must be parented to Epics.</description></item><item><title>Code Review</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/code_review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/code_review/</guid><description>Code Review # Code reviews are used by most sucessful tech companies and generally propagated as a useful tool for several reasons:
Better code quality Learning effects for the coder and the reviewer Increasing the lottery factor There are numerous discussions and opinions of good code reviews out there in every imaginable way of presentation (see &amp;hellip;) but as code reviews are practically non-existent in our group at the time of writing, this document shall only provide some very simple guidelines that can be expanded on when the basics are established.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/getting_started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/getting_started/</guid><description> Getting Started # Install dependencies # Clone the repository # Serve the handbook locally #</description></item><item><title>Standup</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/regular_events/standup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/regular_events/standup/</guid><description>Standup # Current Process # The team has a daily Standup between 09:45 and 10:00 via Zoom.

A member of the team will give a presentation discussing a topic pertinent to their research, current projects or technical skills they are interested in.
The most recent tech chat ‘series’ was ‘Getting to know us’, where members of the team gave presentations on their research interests
Currently internal to the team, largely informal
Proposed Changes # Consider resuming wider community tech chats</description></item><item><title>Twitter</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/communications/twitter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/communications/twitter/</guid><description>Twitter # The group has a Twitter account @sa2c_swansea. The purpose of the account is to have an informal public-facing channel where we can communicate about projects we are working on, and to promote e.g. job opportunities.
Access # If you want to tweet under the group account, ask the account controller for access.
This also gives you access to Some levels.
What to Post # Projects we work on (if public) Blog posts Talks Conferences and workshops Any public outputs — papers, published code etc.</description></item><item><title>Changelogs and Semantic Versioning</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/technical_practices/change_logs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/technical_practices/change_logs/</guid><description> Changelogs # Semantic Versioning #</description></item><item><title>Defining Project Doneness</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining_done/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining_done/</guid><description> Defining Project Doneness #</description></item><item><title>Record</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/projects/record/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/projects/record/</guid><description>Record # Current Process # Record is a private GitHub repository where we keep track of things that we have done at a higher level of detail but a lower level of granularity than is done in Azure DevOps. It is at https://github.com/sa2c/record. Members of SA2C should automatically have access.
For optimisation projects, we keep track of benchmarking data here so we can compare before and after. Where possible we also keep any notes on what was done, to make it easier to pick up work again later.</description></item><item><title>Style Guide</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/style_guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/style_guide/</guid><description> Style Guide # Semantic Line Breaks # Markdown #</description></item><item><title>Adding New Content</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/creating_a_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/creating_a_page/</guid><description> Adding New Content # How Hugo Arranges Content # Creating a New Page #</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Sharing</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/</guid><description> Knowledge Sharing # Daily # ReCoN # Slack # Weekly # RSE Team Meetings # Tech Chat # Approximately Monthly # SA2C Events # RSE Newsletter # SA2C Mailing List # Less frequently or ad-hoc # Code Review # SA2C courses and training # Remote Co-working # Hack Sessions &amp;amp; RSE Collaborative Time # Working on Other Projects #</description></item><item><title>Python Tools and Practices</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/technical_practices/python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/technical_practices/python/</guid><description> Python Tools and Practices # Autoformatters / Linters # Type Checkers # Automation (Pre-Commit &amp;amp; Actions) # Testing tools #</description></item><item><title>Configuring Your Editor</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/technical_practices/configuring_editors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/technical_practices/configuring_editors/</guid><description> Configuring Your Editor # General # VS code # Extensions # Settings # Selecting the Python Interpreter # Linting # Formatting # Running Tests # Debugging # Other Tips and Tricks #</description></item><item><title>Editing a Page</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/editing_a_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/editing_a_page/</guid><description> Editing a Page # Pages # Front Matter # Content # Shortcodes # Repository Shortcodes # repo_link #</description></item><item><title>Meeting Records</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/meeting_record/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/meeting_record/</guid><description> Meeting Records #</description></item><item><title>Contributing Changes</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/contributing_changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/contributing_changes/</guid><description> Contributing Changes # Creating a Branch # Opening a Pull Request # Continuous Integration # Keeping Your Branch up to Date # Merging # Rebasing # The Review Process #</description></item><item><title>Reviewing Changes</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/reviewing_changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/reviewing_changes/</guid><description> Reviewing Changes # Code Quality # Reviewing the Pull Request # Changes # Merging #</description></item><item><title>Advanced</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/advanced/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/contributing/advanced/</guid><description> Advanced # Using Data # Creating Shortcodes # Partial Templates #</description></item></channel></rss>

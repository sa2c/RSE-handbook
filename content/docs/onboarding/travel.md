# Travel

If you need to travel for work reasons,
there are many things to be aware of.
All details can be found on the [Staff Intranet][staff-intranet].
Specific documents to look at include:

- the [Business Travel Policy and Procedure][business-travel-policy],
- the [Expenses Policy and Procedure][expenses-policy].

You should read these in more detail before travelling.
A summary of some non-obvious things to bear in mind:

## International travel

International travel must be approved in advance.
This process takes a week or two;
please start the paperwork moving as soon as you know when youâ€™ll be travelling.
(There is also an online training course.)

## Train travel

Train travel within the UK, and flights and hotels anywhere,
must be booked through [the Travel Planet system][travel-planet],
unless there is a good reason not to
(such as using a conference-provided hotel not available via Travel Planet).

## Travel expenses

Expenses incurred while travelling can (and should!) be reclaimed,
but you do need receipts
(specifically itemized/till receipts, not just credit/debit card receipts).
(An exception is driving your own car,
which is done on the basis of mileage rather than receipted expense.)
This process is limited to things like meals and local travel
that could not be bought in advance via the requisition system.

## Other costs

Conference fees, poster printing, etc. should be paid via
the requisition system on ABW.
Someone who has done this before can walk you through this process.

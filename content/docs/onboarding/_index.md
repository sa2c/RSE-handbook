# Onboarding

We previously had a long checklist of information for new starters.
Much of this has now been migrated to other pages in this handbook.

## Memberships

You should have access to the following resources.
If you don't,
then chase up with the responsible person.
(Your mentor can tell you who this is.)

- The `#SA2C` and `#SA2C-RSE` streams on [ReCoN][communications]
- The [SA2C GitHub organisation][technical-practices]
- The [SA2C internal GitLab instance][technical-practices]
- The shared calendar (see below)
- The [mailing lists][communications]
- The FSE intranet and leave system (see below)
- The shared OneDrive directory,
  containing things like versions of the SA2C logo,
  and occasionally-useful resources

## Shared calendar

We use a shared Google Calendar
for keeping track of events that are relevant to multiple team members,
and when we will be unavailable
(e.g. due to travel or leave).

## Training

[We run regular training][training].
Upcoming training is listed in the shared calendar.
It would be good to familiarise yourself with the topics
in advance of the event,
even though you are unlikely to deliver it.

## Benefits

Swansea University provides a number of employment benefits—
this includes car leasing,
tax-advantaged bike purchasing,
and discounts on many common retailers.
You can access these via [Edenred][edenred].

## IT

For central IT-related matters
(e.g. managed desktops
or problems with centrally-managed services like email and networking)
you can contact [the Service Desk][service-desk].

### Networking

If you need to connect a machine to the wired network,
you need to provide the MAC address to the [Service Desk][service-desk].

Swansea University uses Eduroam for its wireless connectivity.
You can join the SwanseaUni-Setup network to access the registration page,
and download tools to set up your device.
Once you have Eduroam set up,
you should be able to use it at any university that uses the service
(the “roam” in “Eduroam”),
without needing to change any details.

### Printing

If you need to print,
there are printers in the post rooms
on the third and fourth floors of the Computational Foundry.
They use a cloud-based printing service
so there is only one printer to install,
which is visible from Eduroam and the wired network.

## Intranets

The University has multiple Intranets, with a confusing breakdown of what is where:

### The Intranet

[The Intranet][intranet] is gradually reducing in importance,
but does provide timetables for University-managed rooms,
and plans of all University buildings.

### Staff Intranet

[The Staff Intranet][staff-intranet] hosts internal information pages.
The search box is relatively good
(as it needs to be, as the site isn’t indexed by search engines).
Most information about policies and procedures can be found here.

### Faculty Intranet

[The Faculty of Science and Engineering Intranet][fse-intranet] is used by us
primarily to manage our annual leave.

You need to be added to this site manually.
If you don’t yet have access, remind your line manager to request this.

### Unit4 ERP

[Unit4 ERP][abw]
(formerly known as Agresso Business World,
which some people will still use interchangeably with it),
is where the University is gradually consolidating a lot of functionality.
(This is despite it being barely usable.)
This is where you:

- Check and update your personnel information
  (some fields are read-only;
  to update these, contact [the Faculty HR](fse-hr@swansea.ac.uk))
- Register for centrally-provided training courses
- Find your pay slips and tax paperwork (e.g. P60 forms)
- Submit expenses claims
- Submit requisitions if you need to make a purchase
  (e.g. a conference ticket)
- Prepare costings for grant submissions and send them for internal approval

### SharePoint

The University has a SharePoint instance,
with access-controlled subdivisions.
The main piece of information of relevance to use
that is accessible to us here
is [the availability of meeting rooms within FSE][fse-rooms],
including within the Computational Foundry.

## The wider RSE community

If this is your first RSE post,
you will want to start making connections with the wider UK RSE community.
The primary place to do this is via [the UKRSE Slack][ukrse-slack].
You can join without invitation using your @swansea.ac.uk email address.
You may also with to consider joining
[the Society of Research Software Engineering][soc-rse].

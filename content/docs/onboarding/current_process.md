# Current Process

Run through the following checklist:

- We use a Zulip instance called ReCoN (Research Computing Network) for communication within the team and with the user community; you will be added to the #SA2C and #SA2C-RSE internal streams, please join any other streams that you are interested in (the cog-shaped icon next to STREAMS on the left lets you do this)

- We try to keep an eye out for users asking questions related to topics we are able to support; we don't have very many of these at the moment, but it's something we hope will develop

- We are the SA2C organisation on GitHub (https://github.com/sa2c); if you haven’t already been added, please remind Ed to do this.

- If we are running training in the next few weeks, what are the topics, where is the material so that new starter can familiarize with it.

- Swansea University provides a number of employment benefits—this includes car leasing, tax-advantaged bike purchasing, and discounts on many common retailers. You can access these via https://www.edenred.uk.com/.

- We use a shared Google Calendar for keeping track of events that are relevant to multiple team members, and when we will be unavailable (e.g. due to travel or leave).

- For central IT-related matters (e.g. managed desktops or problems with centrally-managed services like email and networking) you can contact the Service Desk at https://servicedesk.swansea.ac.uk.

- You will want to join the sa2c-users and sa2c-training mailing lists. The information pages at https://mailman.swan.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/sa2c-users and https://mailman.swan.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/sa2c-training are available from Eduroam and via the VPN.

- The University has multiple Intranets, with a confusing breakdown of what is where:

    - The Intranet, at https://intranet.swansea.ac.uk, is gradually reducing in importance, but does provide timetables for University-managed rooms, and plans of all University buildings.

    - The Staff Intranet, at https://staff.swansea.ac.uk, hosts internal information pages. The search box is relatively good (as it needs to be, as the site isn’t indexed by search engines). Most information about policies and procedures can be found here.

    - The Faculty of Science and Engineering Intranet at https://fse-intranet.swansea.ac.uk, is used by us primarily to manage our annual leave.

        - You need to be added to this site manually. If you don’t yet have access, remind your line manager to request this.

- Unit4 ERP (formerly known as Agresso Business World, which some people will still use interchangeably with it), is at https://abw.swansea.ac.uk. The University is gradually consolidating a lot more functionality into this, despite it being barely usable. This is where you:

    - Check and update your personnel information (some fields are read-only; to update these, contact fse-hr@swansea.ac.uk)

    - Register for centrally-provided training courses

    - Find your pay slips and tax paperwork (e.g. P60 forms)

    - Submit expenses claims

    - Submit requisitions if you need to make a purchase (e.g. a conference ticket)

    - Prepare costings for grant submissions and send them for internal approval

- We have an internal GitLab instance at https://sa2c-gitlab.swansea.ac.uk. While we primarily use GitHub both for internal and externally-facing projects now, there are a few situations where we want to keep things on-premises.

- New users are marked as external by default; you need to be promoted to internal to have fuller access. Speak to Ed to arrange this.

- If this is your first RSE post, you will want to start making connections with the wider UK RSE community. The primary place to do this is via the UKRSE Slack at https://ukrse.slack.com. You can join without invitation using your @swansea.ac.uk email address. You may also with to consider joining the Society of Research Software Engineering at https://society-rse.org.

- We have a shared OneDrive folder for resources useful to the RSE team (e.g. logos); if you have not already had an invitation to join this, speak to Ed to remind them.

- Room availability for FSE-managed rooms can be checked via SharePoint at https://swanseauniversity.sharepoint.com/schools/science/rooms/. These can be booked via an email to fse-reception@swansea.ac.uk.

- Networking:

    - If you need to connect a machine to the wired network, you need to provide the MAC address to the Service Desk.

    - Swansea University uses Eduroam for its wireless connectivity. You can join the SwanseaUni-Setup network to access the registration page, and download tools to set up your device. Once you have Eduroam set up, you should be able to use it at any university that uses the service (the “roam” in “Eduroam”), without needing to change any details.

- If you need to print, there are printers in the post rooms on the third and fourth floors of the Computational Foundry. They use a cloud-based printing service so there is only one printer to install, which is visible from Eduroam and the wired network.

- If you need to travel for work reasons, things to be aware of:

    - Train travel within the UK, and flights and hotels anywhere, must be booked through the Travel Planet system, unless there is a good reason not to (such as using a conference-provided hotel not available via Travel Planet)

    - International travel must be approved in advance. This process takes a week or two; please start the paperwork moving as soon as you know when you’ll be travelling. (There is also an online training course.)

    - Other costs (e.g. conference fees, poster printing) should be paid via the requisition system on ABW. Someone who has done this before can walk you through this process.

    - Expenses incurred while travelling can (and should!) be reclaimed, but you do need receipts (specifically itemized/till receipts, not just credit/debit card receipts). (An exception is driving your own car, which is done on the basis of mileage rather than receipted expense.) This process is limited to things like meals and local travel that could not be bought in advance via the requisition system.

    - More detail on all of these can be found on the Staff Intranet. There are two relevant policies: the Business Travel Policy and the Expenses Policy. Please get familiar with both of them before you travel.

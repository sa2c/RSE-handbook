# Proposed Changes

- Would be good to split out a checklist for team leaders (accounts and permissions) that can be done asynchronously from the induction meeting, and turn some of the information here into a document that can be read (possibly with check-boxes for “yep, got that”), rather than it being a long talk that mostly goes over the new starter’s head.

- Unfortunately we can’t avoid needing to go through HR’s induction spiel, which is potentially more boring than the one above.

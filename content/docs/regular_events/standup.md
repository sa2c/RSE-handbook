# Standup

- The team has a daily Standup between 09:45 and 10:00 via Zoom.
- Topic
    - What has been achieved in the last day
    - What will be achieved in the next day 
    - what could get in the way
- If a team member is not available to attend Stantup, it can be updated on ReCoN.
- (Optional) If some team members wish to discuss other specific items like technical solutions or coordinating other actions, those who wish to can stay on the Zoom call.

# Standup

The RSE team has a daily Standup between 09:45 and 10:00 via Zoom. The aim of these daily meetings is for RSEs to briefly update the other members of the team on their activities on the previous day and to outline what is planned for the rest of the current day. On days where a weekly team meeting is scheduled, the team meeting takes precedence and Standup will be omitted.

- Typical topic order:
  - What has been achieved in the last day
  - What will be achieved in the next day
  - What could get in the way
  - (Optional) If some team members wish to discuss other specific items
  like technical solutions or coordinating other actions, those who wish to can stay on the Zoom call.
- Team member order is decided during the meeting, with the first member to present selecting the second, and so on until all present have spoken.

If a team member is not available to attend Standup, a Virtual Standup ReCoN thread can be used to update the team.

# Standup

The team has a daily Standup between 09:45 and 10:00 via Zoom.
Each team member summarises the work done yesterday and what to achieve today.
If a team member is not available to attend Stantup, he/she can update on ReCoN.
If some team members wish to discuss other specific items like technical solutions or coordinating other actions, those who wish to can stay on the Zoom call.

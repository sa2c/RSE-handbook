# Team Meeting

The team has a Weekly, typically Mondays (sometimes shifted due to unavailability or bank holidays), 1 hour allocated, target time 30-45 minutes, conducted via Zoom.

Order of discussion:

Calendar – discuss events for the coming week, some brief mentions of activities in the previous and next week. Typically use screen share of Google calendar. Estimated time: 3-5 minutes.

Projects – updates on the project listing, commenting on status of work items, keep up to date on collaborative projects. Project listings displayed with in-house Azure DevOps Emacs client. Estimated time: 20-30 minutes.

Support – briefly summarize support provided by the team to users. Estimated time: 3-5 minutes.

Efficiency Monitoring – evaluation of user efficiencies on the Sunbird cluster, noting idle node hours and job efficiencies as main indicators. Consider contacting users for support if efficiency drops below 70% with >50 node hours wasted (rough metrics, varies case by case). Prioritise any projects with <40% efficiency to avoid them appearing in Cardiff’s data. Estimated time: 5-7 minutes.

Any Other Business (AOB) - raise miscellaneous items not covered in previous sections. Estimated time: 3-5 minutes.

(Optional) Follow-up meetings – if time remains in the hour allocation and some team members wish to discuss other specific items like technical solutions or coordinating other actions, those who wish to can stay on the Zoom call.

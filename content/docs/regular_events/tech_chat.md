# Tech Chat

- Ad-hoc schedule, historically Tuesdays 10-11am, conducted via Zoom
- A member of the team will give a presentation discussing a topic
  pertinent to their research,
  current projects
  or technical skills they are interested in.
- The most recent tech chat ‘series’ was ‘Getting to know us’,
  where members of the team gave presentations on their research interests
- Currently internal to the team, largely informal

# Support



## Current Process

The RSE team at SA2C can help with a variety of aspects.

- Grant application preparation: If you are applying for a grant for a project that will require HPC, and you need to evidence that your software is ready to run on it, we can run scaling tests and provide a detailed benchmark report to evidence your application. We can also assist with the process of porting the application so it will be ready to run on HPC.
- Onboarding: If you have computational work that is slow enough to be a barrier to the research outputs when run on your desktop, but don't know where to start moving to HPC, talk to us and we can provide assistance and guidance with this process.
- Performance tuning: If you already have applications making use of HPC that you need to run faster, we can work with you to profile and tune your application's performance to make most efficient use of the available hardware. 
- Advice on technical specification for procurement: If you need to procure any technical equipment or software our team can advise you on the technical specification required in preperation for the procurement process.
- Install applications on managed clusters: If you are using SUNBIRD or another computational resources managed by SA2C and need to make use of software that is not currently available there, then SA2C is able to provide assistance in installing the software you require. SA2C is also able to provide advice and support on procuring commercial software.
- Hosting and management: If you require any computational hardware for your research SA2C can host and manage this for you. We have a wide range of experience in hosting computational resources and any problems that occur can be either repaired more rapidly or avoided entirely via proactive monitoring and maintenance.

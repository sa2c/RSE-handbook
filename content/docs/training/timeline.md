# Timeline of training

The following steps are needed for a workshop.

## Months before a workshop

- What workshops will be delivered in a semester are decided,
  as well as which will be in-person/online.
- These are communicated to the Postgraduate Office,
  who arrange for room bookings and registration pages.
- The workshop landing pages are created based on The Carpentries template.
- When registration pages are available,
  details are circulated to mailing lists.
- Carpentries workshops are registered with The Carpentries.

## Weeks before a workshop

- For in-person events, we ensure that sufficient catering is available.

## Around 48 hours before the workshop starts

- Registrations are closed
- A pre-workshop email is sent to those who have registered.
   - Details of the programme,
   This contains:
   - Links to join the Zoom call if it is online,
   - A pre-workshop survey,
   - Information about the setup help session,
   - A link to the code of conduct, and
   - Instructions on how to set up their computer ready for the event
   A template for the email is [provided by The Carpentries][carpentries-email]
- Registered participants are added to a shared spreadsheet in OneDrive,
  which records everyone who has attended any of our workshops.
   - [Microsoft Delve][delve] is used to get more information on staff
   - [The Intranet][intranet] is used to get more information on students
   We record the college
   (not faculty for legacy and precision reasons),
   and the status
   (student/researcher/academic/staff)
   of each learner.

## Around 24 hours before the workshop starts

- There is a setup help drop-in session on Zoom
  to allow anyone having difficulty with the setup instructions
  to get help before the workshop starts,
  rather than disrupting the event.
   - One RSE should staff this.
   - Typically no workshop participants attend these,
     so they require little work.

## The evening before the start of the workshop

- For in-person workshops on Singleton,
  someone with a car transports catering supplies from the Foundry.

## An hour before the start of the workshop

- For in-person workshops,
  we move catering from the office or car to the venue,
  and set up the coffee station.

## At the start of the workshop

- We discuss the [housekeeping points][housekeeping].

## At the end of the workshop

- We discuss the [housekeeping points][housekeeping].

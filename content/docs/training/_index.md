# Training

We organise training on various aspects of research software.
We do this because we want users to be more skilled
so they are able to better take advantage of the available facilities,
to reduce the amount of one on one support needed
(and shift it to being at a higher level),
and ultimately to try and empower researchers to do more and better research.
It also provides a good opportunity to grow our network,
so more people are aware of who we are and what we do
(outside of delivering training).

## Learning to teach

Teaching people to use or write software
is a different skill from using it or writing it ourselves,
so we need to be trained to do this.
We use The Carpentries Instructor Training for this purpose.

You should have completed The Carpentries instructor checkout
before delivering a lesson.

## Material

We deliver material from The Carpentries,
including [Software Carpentry][swc] and [Data Carpentry][dc],
as well as material we have developed ourselves in the same style.

## Timings

Training workshops are a mix of online and in-person.

### In-person workshops

In-person workshops are for full days 9:00–17:00
with 1 hour for lunch
(12:30&mdash;13:30).

### Online workshops

Online workshops are done via Zoom,
and are 3.5 hours per day,
either 9:30–13:00 or 13:00–16:30.
A 2-day in-person event becomes a 5-half-day online workshop;
others remain the same number of half days.

## Publicity

Workshops are advertised to the sa2c-training mailing list,
as well as via the postgraduate research office.

## Signup

Signup is via Tocyn Cymru,
a ticketing service vaguely similar to
(but much less intrusive than)
ventbrite.

Login details for Tocyn Cymru are available from Ed

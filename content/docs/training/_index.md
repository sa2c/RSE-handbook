# Training

## Current Process

- We organise training on various aspects of research software. We do this because we want users to be more skilled so they are able to better take advantage of the available facilities, to reduce the amount of one on one support needed (and shift it to being at a higher level), and ultimately to try and empower researchers to do more and better research. It also provides a good opportunity to grow our network, so more people are aware of who we are and what we do (outside of delivering training). 

- Teaching people to use or write software is a different skill from using it or writing it ourselves, so we need to be trained to do this. We use The Carpentries Instructor Training for this purpose. 

- We deliver material from The Carpentries, including Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, as well as material we have developed ourselves in the same style. 

- Training workshops are a mix of online and in-person. Online workshops are done via Zoom, and are 3.5 hours per day, either 9:30–13:00 or 13:00–16:30. In-person workshops are for full days 9:00–17:00 with 1 hour for lunch. A 2-day in-person event becomes a 5-half-day online workshop; others remain the same number of half days.  

- Workshops are advertised to the sa2c-training mailing list, as well as via the postgraduate research office. 

- Signup is via Tocyn Cymru, a ticketing service vaguely similar to (but much less intrusive than) Eventbrite. 

    - Login details for this are available from Ed 

- Timeline of a workshop: 

    - At least 48 hours before the start of the workshop, registrations close and a pre-workshop email is sent to those who have registered. This contains details of the programme, links to join the Zoom call if it is online, a pre-workshop survey, a link to the code of conduct, and instructions on how to set up their computer ready for the event. 

    - Around 24 hours before the start of the workshop, there is a setup help drop-in session to allow anyone having difficulty with the setup instructions to get help before the workshop starts rather than disrupting the event. Typically nobody attends these. 

    - For in-person events, the list of registered participants needs to be turned into a register for signing (to justify the catering). 

    - At the start of the workshop, we run through some housekeeping: 

        - Welcome 

        - Who are we, and why are we here? (Introduce the RSE team, SA2C, why we choose to deliver training) 

        - What are we doing?/What is Software Carpentry? (Explain the topics that will be covered, and if this is a Carpentries workshop then explain our relationship with The Carpentries and how the material is collaboratively developed.) 

        - Code of conduct (Remind people of the basics, and highlight things that might not be familiar, such as making fun of people’s technical choices) 

        - If the workshop is on Zoom, then some Zoom-specific aspects: 

            - Cameras aren’t compulsory, but having at least a few switched on makes it much easier to teach 

            - We use reaction buttons to gauge the pace (in place of sticky notes for in-person events), and check at this point that everyone can click “Yes” 

            - For some events we use breakout rooms for smaller discussions, or to provide one-on-one support with someone without disrupting the main room. If this is the plan then we will test here that everyone is able to avoid joining breakout rooms until they need to, then that they can join, and can leave again. 

        - Explanation of how live coding works. This is not normally sufficient—need to remind people regularly that they should be following along and letting us know if they are falling behind. 

            - Mention that they can follow the material as well, as everything we say will be following that closely. 

            - For online workshops, point out that having multiple screens can be useful (e.g. have the notes on a phone or tablet so it doesn’t compete with Zoom and the development environment) 

        - Suggest setting an out-of-office for the duration of the workshop to avoid distractions 

        - Etherpad – share a link to it so that people can make collaborative notes, share links, etc. 

            - Circulate the register at this point—for online events this is a link provided by the PGR office 

        - Rough schedule and when to expect breaks 

        - Hand over to instructor 

    - At the end of the workshop we have some more housekeeping 

        - Feedback survey for the PGR office. Link to post-workshop survey for Carpentries events.  

        - Mention keeping in touch via ReCoN 

        - Invite to join training mailing list (and main mailing list if workshop if HPC specific) 

        - Mention ways of working with RSEs in future beyond training (e.g. write us into grant applications) 

- Registrations from Tocyn are recorded in an Excel spreadsheet stored in Teams/OneDrive/Sharepoint 

    - Additional information is added by hand from searching University records: the status of each learner (student/postdoc/academic) and their college (colleges no longer exist, as they merged to form Faculties, but keeping this division is useful in terms of avoiding having to destroy old data and keeping some structure within the monolithic faculties) 

    - A PivotTable generates summary statistics

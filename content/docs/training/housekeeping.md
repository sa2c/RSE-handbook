# Housekeeping

We have a number of points to discuss at the start and end of a workshop.

## Starting a workshop

- Welcome
- Who are we,
  and why are we here?
  (Introduce the RSE team, SA2C, why we choose to deliver training.)
- What are we doing?
  What is Software Carpentry?
  (Explain the topics that will be covered,
  and if this is a Carpentries workshop
  then explain our relationship with The Carpentries
  and how the material is collaboratively developed.)
- Code of conduct
  (Remind people of the basics,
  and highlight things that might not be familiar,
  such as making fun of people’s technical choices)
- If the workshop is on Zoom:
  - Cameras aren’t compulsory,
    but having at least a few switched on makes it much easier to teach
  - We use reaction buttons to gauge the pace,
    and check at this point that everyone can click “Yes”
  - For some events we use breakout rooms for smaller discussions,
    or to provide one-on-one support with someone
    without disrupting the main room.
    If this is the plan
    then we will test here that everyone is able to avoid joining breakout rooms
    until they need to,
    then that they can join,
    and can leave again.
- If the workshop is in person:
  - Describe the sticky note system
    (green for good, red for help needed),
  - Mention where toilets are,
  - Mention if fire tests are expected,
    and where fire exits are,
  - Mention availability of refreshments.
- Explanation of how live coding works.
  This is not normally sufficient—
  need to remind people regularly
  that they should be following along
  and letting us know if they are falling behind.
  - Mention that they can follow the material as well,
    as everything we say will be following that closely.
  - For online workshops,
    point out that having multiple screens can be useful
    (e.g. have the notes on a phone or tablet
    so it doesn’t compete with Zoom and the development environment)
- Suggest setting an out-of-office for the duration of the workshop to avoid distractions
- Etherpad –
  share a link to it
  so that people can make collaborative notes, share links, etc.
- Circulate the register at this point—
  for online events this is a link provided by the PGR office
- Rough schedule and when to expect breaks
- Hand over to instructor

## Ending a workshop

- Feedback survey for the PGR office.
- Link to post-workshop survey for Carpentries events.
- Mention keeping in touch via ReCoN
- Invite to join training mailing list
  (and main mailing list if workshop if HPC specific)
- Mention ways of working with RSEs in future beyond training
  (e.g. write us into grant applications)

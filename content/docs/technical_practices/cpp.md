# C++ Tools and Practices

If none of the excluding reasons from the general [Tools and Best
Practices][tools-and-best-practices]
applies, do the following:

- Autoformat your code with
  [clang-format][clang-format]
- Lint your code with [clang-tidy][clang-tidy]
- Try to digest and apply [C++ Core Guidelines][cpp-core-guidelines]
  to the best of your abilities
- In case you start from scratch, use  [ModernCppStarter][moderncppstarter].
  Otherwise, use it as a guideline as to how your code could look like.

# C++ Tools and Practices

If none of the excluding reasons from the general [Tools and Best
Practices](https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/technical_practices#tools_and_best_practices)
applies, do the following:

- Autoformat your code with
  [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
- Lint your code with [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)
- Try to digest and apply [C++ Core
  Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) to
  the best of your abilities
- In case you start from scratch, use
  [ModernCppStarter](https://github.com/TheLartians/ModernCppStarter).
  Otherwise, use it as a guideline as to how your code could look like.

# Twitter

The group has a Twitter account [@sa2c_swansea](https://twitter.com/sa2c_swansea). The purpose of the account is to have an informal public-facing channel where we can communicate about projects we are working on, and to promote e.g. job opportunities. 

## Access

If you want to tweet under the group account, ask ``the account controller`` for access.

This also gives you access to `` Some levels ``.

## What to Post

- Projects we work on (if public)
- Blog posts
- Talks
- Conferences and workshops
- Any public outputs â€” papers, published code _etc._

Please refer to the ``SA2C Social Media Policy`` when making posts.

# Communications

## ReCoN

The group has a Zulip platform, [Research Computing Network][recon],
for Swansea University staff and students to communicate with SA2C.
It is also the daily communication platform for members of SA2C.

We use the `#SA2C-RSE` stream to communicate within the team,
and the `#SA2C` stream to communicate with the wider SA2C team.
These are private to the team;
if you haven't been added,
then contact one of the admins.

We try to keep an eye out for users asking questions
related to topics we are able to support.
This traffic is not usually very high.

To join public streams,
click the cog-shaped icon next to STREAMS on the left.

## Twitter

- [Twitter]({{< relref "/docs/communications/twitter.md" >}})

## Email

The group has a dedicated email address (sa2c-support@swansea.ac.uk),
currently managed by the technical team.

## Mailing lists

We have two mailing lists for contacting people outside the team.

- [`sa2c-users`][sa2c-users] is for general HPC-related information.
- [`sa2c-training`][sa2c-training] is for details of upcoming training events.

The information pages for these are available via Eduroam and the VPN.

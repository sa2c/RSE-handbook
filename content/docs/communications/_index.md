# Communications

## ReCoN

The group has a Zulip platform, [Research Computing Network](https://recon.swansea.ac.uk), for Swansea University staff and students to communicate with SA2C. It is also the daily communication platform for members of SA2C.

## Twitter

- [Twitter]({{< relref "/docs/communications/twitter.md" >}})

## Email

The group has a dedicated email address (sa2c-support@swansea.ac.uk), currently managed by the technical team.

## Proposed Changes

- Include ReCoN in outgoing emails. (Discussed before)

- Regular update on Twitter. (Who is managing this Twitter account?)

- Include SA2Câ€™s Twitter account in outgoing emails.

- Do we have a social media policy?

- Make it a group Twitter account?

- What to post? For example, projects, talks, training workshops, conferences, public outputs (papers, published code etc.)?

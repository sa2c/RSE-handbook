# Knowledge Sharing

This page lists the tools, resources and activities that this team has to promote
general communication as well as sharing and gaining knowledge across the team
and the university as a whole, and some thoughts on what we could try to improve
this. If you’re looking to learn something new, get help with a problem, share
something cool you’ve been doing, or find out what others in the team are doing,
the list below may give an idea of where to look/what to try.

## Daily

### ReCoN

[ReCoN](https://recon.swansea.ac.uk) (Research Communication Network) is the
name of our local [Zulip](https://zulip.com/) instance. It serves two main
purposes:

  - Communication within the team
  - Providing a support channel for users to reach out to us

The latter purpose is discussed under
[Support](https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/support/).

Our main daily communication happens within the `#SA2C-RSE` stream. There is
also a slightly broader (in terms of members) `#SA2C` stream as well as a
moderate number of further public topic-specific streams. Unfortunately, the
latter are barely used but occasionally you might find just the right audience
to ask topic-specific questions or spark discussions there. Have a look around!

While using ReCoN please make sure to keep our conversations organised and easy
to follow by the use of [topics](https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics)
within our streams. You can even assign them in retrospective as conversations
might very well drift from one topic to another.

There are a few topics worth to be aware of:

  - There is a `Virtual Standup` topic if you can't attend the
    [Standup](https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/how_we_work/knowledge_sharing/#standup).
  - There is a `Today I learned` topic for small bits of interesting things you
    might stumble across in your daily work.

### Standup

This is discussed in more detail as a regular event in
[Standup](https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/regular_events/standup/).

### Azure DevOps

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
We use [Azure
DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/swansea-university/Swansea%20Academy%20of%20Advanced%20Computing/_workitems/recentlyupdated/)
for tracking the progress of our projects. Check out [Azure
DevOps](https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/projects/azure_devops/) for
details.

### Interesting Slack Workspaces

You should consider becoming part of the [RSE-Slack](https://ukrse.slack.com)
which started off as a nationwide RSE network but has even outgrown that and is
more of an international platform by now. Lots of interesting discussions and
topic-specific channels on there. Also, it is a good place to ask detailed
technical questions.

Others might be interesting depending on your precise affiliation. Talk to your
line manager.

## Weekly

### RSE Team Meetings

Details about the weekly team meetings are provided under [Team
Meeting](https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/regular_events/team_meeting/).
They constitute our main strategic coordination over the week.

### Tech Chat and further events

We seem to have had further interesting formats once. Given the small size of
the team, the effort of organising these is non-neglible and there is no
activity currently. But we all agreed upon working on this document that it
would be nice to revive them, so stay tuned for updates here!

## (Roughly) Monthly

### One-To-Ones

We try to have one-to-one meetings with our line manager roughly every three
to four weeks. Their explicit purpose is not to talk about technical details or
project related things but rather anything about the working environment,
personal development, management style, and other things that you feel could -- or
already do -- contribute to how you feel about work. At the very least they are
a nice and light conversation to get to know each other better, but if there is
anything that you feel your line manager or the team could improve to make you
feel better, this is a dedicated occasion and safe space to bring that up. Of
course, you are welcome to share such things at any other time you feel
comfortable doing so.

# Meeting Records

When a synchronous meeting is unavoidable, it is critical to produce a clear and
thorough record.

The meeting record is important as a reference for what happened at the meeting.
In particular, any decisions made or actions assigned need to be clearly
recorded for future reference.

A good record will also be invaluable to anyone who was not able to attend an in
person meeting.

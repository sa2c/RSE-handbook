# Meeting Records

## Current process

There is currently no standardised method of taking and curating meeting
records. For collaborative notes, we sometimes use shared MS Word documents and
for asynchronous sharing git(hub/lab) repositories.

## Proposed changes

We could introduce a more standardised method and the [REG
Handbook](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/meeting_record/)
proposes one way to do so. However, we should probably be careful which meetings
could benefit from this precisely because for our very small team meetings are
usually only one or two people who can probably coordinate better between
themselves.

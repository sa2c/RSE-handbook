These are structured in a relatively prescriptive way
Each project is created as a “team” and “area path” in Azure DevOps language.
Overarching areas of work within projects are created as Epics. Many/most projects have a single Epic.
Goals within an area are created as Features. Features must be parented to Epics.</description></item><item><title>Record</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/projects/record/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/projects/record/</guid><description>Record # Record is a private GitHub repository where we keep track of things that we have done at a higher level of detail but a lower level of granularity than is done in Azure DevOps. Members of SA2C should automatically have access.
Optimisation projects # For optimisation projects, we keep track of benchmarking data here so we can compare before and after. Where possible we also keep any notes on what was done, to make it easier to pick up work again later.</description></item></channel></rss>

We use a Zulip instance called ReCoN (Research Computing Network) for communication within the team and with the user community; you will be added to the #SA2C and #SA2C-RSE internal streams, please join any other streams that you are interested in (the cog-shaped icon next to STREAMS on the left lets you do this)
We try to keep an eye out for users asking questions related to topics we are able to support; we don&amp;rsquo;t have very many of these at the moment, but it&amp;rsquo;s something we hope will develop</description></item><item><title>Buddy System</title><link>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/onboarding/proposed_changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sa2c.github.io/RSE-handbook/docs/onboarding/proposed_changes/</guid><description>Proposed Changes # Would be good to split out a checklist for team leaders (accounts and permissions) that can be done asynchronously from the induction meeting, and turn some of the information here into a document that can be read (possibly with check-boxes for “yep, got that”), rather than it being a long talk that mostly goes over the new starter’s head.
Unfortunately we can’t avoid needing to go through HR’s induction spiel, which is potentially more boring than the one above.</description></item></channel></rss>
